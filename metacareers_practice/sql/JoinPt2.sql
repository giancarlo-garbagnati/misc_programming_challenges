Please refer to the schema and prompt on the right.
Note that in this editor, you are using a SQLite database. In the interview you will run the queries against a PostgreSQL database. Yet knowing standard ANSI SQL is sufficient for the interview.
Please feel free to collapse this panel to simulate a real interview experience.
Below are hints you can use to write the correct query.
HINTS
Can we use the percentage of product categories that did sell to help us compute this?

 BACKGROUND:
 
 The following schema is a subset of a relational database of a grocery store
 chain. This chain sells many products of different product classes to its
 customers across its different stores. It also conducts many different
 promotion campaigns.
 
 The relationship between the four tables we want to analyze is depicted below:
 
        # sales                                # products
        +------------------+---------+         +---------------------+---------+

        | store_id         | INTEGER |    +---<| product_class_id    | INTEGER |
        | customer_id      | INTEGER |    |    | brand_name          | VARCHAR |

 PROMPT:
 -- The VP of Sales feels that some product categories don't sell
 -- and can be completely removed from the inventory.
 -- As a first pass analysis, they want you to find what percentage
 -- of product categories have never been sold.
 
 EXPECTED OUTPUT:
 Note: Please use the column name(s) specified in the expected output in your solution.
 +-----------------------------------+
 | pct_product_categories_never_sold |
 +-----------------------------------+
 |               13.8888888888888889 |
